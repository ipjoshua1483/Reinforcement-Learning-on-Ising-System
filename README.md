# Reinforcement Learning on Ising System

This repository contains the implmentation of a comparison of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Neuroevolution of Augmented Technologies (NEAT) from gradient-free evolutionary optimization on magnetization reversal of the Ising system. This provides a theoretical framework for energy consumption reduction in control of nanoscale magnetic systems that are crucial for data storage technologies.

## Ising System
The Ising system is described by a 2D lattice structure where the objective is to flip the signs of the spins and minimize the entropy while satisfying temperature and magnetic field constraints.
